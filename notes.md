## 1. Basic System Initialization

### Login as User & View Partitions (`lsblk`):
- **Command**: `lsblk`
  - **Description**: Lists information about all available block devices (disks and partitions).
  - **Purpose**: To verify that partitions have been created correctly and that **LVM** is set up as expected.
  - **Common Flags**: 
    - `-f`: Shows the filesystem type.
    - `-o`: Customizes the output columns (e.g., `lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT`).

## 2. Sudo Installation and Configuration

### Install Sudo:
- **Become the Root User**: Run `su -`
  - **`su -`**: Switches to the root user. The `-` option starts a login shell, loading root's environment variables.

- **Update the System**:
  ```bash
  apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y
  ```
  - **`apt-get update`**: Updates the list of available packages and their versions.
  - **`-y`**: Automatically answers "yes" to prompts.
  - **`apt-get upgrade`**: Installs the latest versions of all packages currently installed on the system.

- **Install Sudo**:
  ```bash
  apt install sudo
  ```
  - **`apt install`**: Installs a package.
  - **`sudo`**: A utility that allows permitted users to execute commands as the root user or another user.

### Add User to Sudo Group:
- **Command**: `usermod -aG sudo your_username`
  - **`usermod`**: Modifies a user account.
  - **`-aG`**: Adds the user to the specified group without removing them from other groups (`-a` means append).
  - **Purpose**: Adding your user to the `sudo` group grants the user administrative privileges.

### Configure Sudoers File:
- **Command**: `sudo visudo`
  - **`visudo`**: Opens the `/etc/sudoers` file safely, ensuring proper syntax before saving.
  - **Editing**: Add a line like `your_username    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL` to grant full administrative privileges.
  - **Explanation**: This line allows `your_username` to execute any command as any user or group.

---

## 3. SSH Installation and Configuration

### Install OpenSSH Server:
- **Command**: `sudo apt install openssh-server`
  - **`openssh-server`**: Installs the SSH server, allowing remote login via SSH.
  - **Purpose**: To allow secure remote access to the VM.

### Configure SSH Port:
- **Command**: `sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
  - **`vim`**: A text editor used to modify files.
  - **Edit**: Change the line `#Port 22` to `Port 4242` to set SSH to listen on port 4242.
  - **Reason**: Changing the default port reduces exposure to automated attacks that target the default SSH port (22).

### Restart SSH:
- **Command**: `sudo service ssh restart`
  - **`service`**: Manages services on the system.
  - **`restart`**: Restarts the SSH service to apply the new configuration.

---

## 4. Firewall Configuration (UFW)

### Install UFW and Enable Rules:
- **Install UFW**:
  ```bash
  apt-get install ufw
  ```
  - **`ufw`**: Uncomplicated Firewall, a frontend for `iptables` to simplify firewall management.

- **Enable UFW**:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw enable
  ```
  - **Purpose**: Activates the firewall to start filtering traffic based on configured rules.

- **Allow SSH and Port 4242**:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow ssh
  sudo ufw allow 4242
  ```
  - **`allow ssh`**: Opens the default SSH port (22).
  - **`allow 4242`**: Opens the custom SSH port (4242) for remote access.

---

## 5. SSH Remote Access Setup

### Port Forwarding in VirtualBox:
- **Purpose**: Set port forwarding in VirtualBox to forward traffic from the host to the VMâ€™s SSH port.
  - **Steps**: Go to **Settings** > **Network** > **Adapter 1** > **Advanced** > **Port Forwarding**.
  - **Add Rule**: Set **Host Port** and **Guest Port** to **4242**.

### Connect via SSH:
- **Command**: `ssh your_username@127.0.0.1 -p 4242`
  - **`ssh`**: Secure Shell, used to connect to remote machines.
  - **`-p 4242`**: Specifies the custom port number (4242).
  - **IP Address**: `127.0.0.1` is the loopback address, referring to the local machine.

---

## 6. Password Policy Configuration

### Install PAM Quality Library:
- **Command**: `sudo apt-get install libpam-pwquality`
  - **`libpam-pwquality`**: Enforces password complexity requirements to improve security.

### Edit Password Rules:
- **File**: `/etc/pam.d/common-password`
  - **Configuration**: Add rules such as `minlen=10 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1` to enforce password length and complexity.

### Password Expiry Configuration:
- **File**: `/etc/login.defs`
  - **Edit**:
  ```
  PASS_MAX_DAYS 30
  PASS_MIN_DAYS 2
  PASS_WARN_AGE 7
  ```
  - **Explanation**:
    - **`PASS_MAX_DAYS`**: Maximum number of days a password is valid.
    - **`PASS_MIN_DAYS`**: Minimum number of days between password changes.
    - **`PASS_WARN_AGE`**: Number of days before password expiration that a warning is given.

---

## 7. User and Group Management

### Create Groups:
- **Command**: `sudo groupadd user42`
  - **`groupadd`**: Creates a new group.
  - **Purpose**: To organize users and assign permissions based on group membership.

### Create and Add Users to Groups:
- **Create a New User**:
  ```bash
  sudo adduser new_username
  ```
  - **`adduser`**: Creates a new user account and sets up the home directory.

- **Add User to Group**:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG user42 your_username
  ```
  - **`usermod -aG`**: Adds the user to a group without affecting existing group memberships.

---

## 8. Sudo Log Setup

### Create Log Directory:
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  cd /var/log
  mkdir sudo
  cd sudo
  touch sudo.log
  ```
  - **Purpose**: Set up a dedicated log file for `sudo` commands for auditing purposes.

### Configure Sudoers to Log:
- **Edit `/etc/sudoers`** to add:
  ```
  Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
  ```
  - **Purpose**: Logs all `sudo` command usage to `/var/log/sudo/sudo.log` for tracking administrative actions.

---

## 9. Monitoring Script Setup

### Create `monitoring.sh` Script:
- **Commands**:
  ```bash
  cd /usr/local/bin/
  touch monitoring.sh
  chmod 755 monitoring.sh
  ```
  - **`chmod 755`**: Grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read and execute permissions to others. This is more secure than `777`.

- **Script Contents**:
  - The script should gather system metrics such as **CPU load**, **memory usage**, **disk space**, etc. Example script:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    arc=$(uname -a)
    pcpu=$(grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | sort | uniq | wc -l)
    vcpu=$(grep "^processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
    fram=$(free -m | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $2}')
    uram=$(free -m | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}')
    pram=$(free | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {printf("%.2f"), $3/$2*100}')
    fdisk=$(df -BG | grep '^/dev/' | grep -v '/boot$' | awk '{ft += $2} END {print ft}')
    udisk=$(df -BM | grep '^/dev/' | grep -v '/boot$' | awk '{ut += $3} END {print ut}')
    pdisk=$(df -BM | grep '^/dev/' | grep -v '/boot$' | awk '{ut += $3} {ft+= $2} END {printf("%d"), ut/ft*100}')
    cpul=$(top -bn1 | grep "^%Cpu" | cut -c 9- | xargs | awk '{printf("%.1f%%"), $1 + $3}')
    lb=$(who -b | awk '$1 == "system" {print $3 " " $4}')
    lvmu=$(if [ $(lsblk | grep "lvm" | wc -l) -eq 0 ]; then echo no; else echo yes; fi)
    ctcp=$(ss -Ht state established | wc -l)
    ulog=$(users | wc -w)
    ip=$(hostname -I)
    mac=$(ip link show | grep "ether" | awk '{print $2}')
    cmds=$(journalctl _COMM=sudo | grep COMMAND | wc -l)
    wall "\n#Architecture: $arc\n#CPU physical: $pcpu\n#vCPU: $vcpu\n#Memory Usage: $uram/${fram}MB ($pram%)\n#Disk Usage: $udisk/${fdisk}Gb ($pdisk%)\n#CPU load: $cpul\n#Last boot: $lb\n#LVM use: $lvmu\n#Connections TCP: $ctcp ESTABLISHED\n#User log: $ulog\n#Network: IP $ip ($mac)\n#Sudo: $cmds cmd"
    ```

### Automate with Cron:
- **Command**: `sudo crontab -u root -e`
  - Add the following line to schedule the script every 10 minutes:
    ```
    */10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
    ```
  - **Purpose**: Automates the execution of the monitoring script to gather system metrics every 10 minutes.

## 10. Signature Creation

### Create Signature for VM Disk:
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  shasum /path/to/VirtualBox.vdi
  ```
  - **Purpose**: Generates a unique signature (hash) for the VM disk file, which can be used to verify its integrity.
  - **Explanation**: The `shasum` command calculates a SHA checksum, which ensures that the disk file has not been tampered with.
